                <li>Mjenzi has developed capability to support customers with IoT integration with Ruby on Rails as our chosen development platform as it

                makes it extremely easy to develop, integrate and implement upon. Our contribution to IoT comes through the enablement of

                seamless API integrations on Ruby on Rails. We do not intend to duplicate the existing IoT ecosystem but rather partner with

                champions in the industry to deliver customised IoT supports to our clients when and where they need them the most.</li>

                <li>Our role in IoT will also be an advisory one, providing advice to our clients on suitable platforms, networks and devices to adopt in their

                IoT strategic plans. Through our partnerships in the local Australian IoT space, we can delivery tailored solutions to our customers

                around service verticals such as transport, health, farming, shopping, service management, automatic monitoring and utility

                management.</li>

                <li>IoT includes machines, devices and things that communicate with people, systems and with each other. As more people use IoT

                devices, it creates opportunities for businesses as there is overwhelming data generated by these devices that can enable and inform

                better business analytics. Mjenzi places itself strategically along the IoT continuum providing IoT implementation advice through to the

                associated analysis of the resultant big data.</li>
